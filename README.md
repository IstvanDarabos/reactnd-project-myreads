# MyReads Project
A bookshelf app that allows you to categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 
The project uses React for the UI and provides an API server to save your library.


## Backend Server
[`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

### Install and Run the App
From your command line run:

git clone https://github.com/IstvanDarabos/reactnd-project-myreads.git
npm install

This will download the sources to the folder reactMyReadings/ and then cd into it to finish 
installing dependencies using npm. If you prefer yarn to manage dependencies change that last command and use yarn install instead.
Once this is finished to launch the app you can run:

npm start

### `update`
This will start a server and launch your default browser pointing
to URL localhost:3000. In case no browser is opened.
You can start one and write that URL in the browsers address box.
